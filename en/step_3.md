## Monster parts
The monsters you're going to generate have three parts to their name: a beginning, a middle, and an end. Here's a few suggestions for each, but make up some of your own too!

### Beginnings
  - Giant
  - Mega
  - Lesser

### Middles
  - Draco
  - Ice
  - Uni

### Ends
  - Cat
  - Ghost
  - Dragon

- To start your program, you'll need three **lists** in Python, one for beginnings, one for middles, and one for ends.

## Python lists
Python has a type of variable called a list. It's used when you have a group of items that you want to keep together in one variable. They're usually all related somehow, like the songs released by a band, or the players on a sports team.

#### Empty lists
This list has nothing in it yet â€” you can add items to it later:

```python
my_list = []
```

#### Lists with things in them
This list has some numbers in it. Notice the commas (`,`) between them. These tell Python where each item in the list ends.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

This list has some text in it. Again, notice the commas.

```python
my_list = ['cat',
           'dog',
           'rabbit']
```

You'll need to have three lists in your code, like this:

```python
name_start = ['Giant',
              'Mega',
              'Lesser'
              ]

name_middle = ['Draco',
               'Ice',
               'Uni'
               ]

name_end = ['Cat',
            'Ghost',
            'Dragon'
            ]
```
