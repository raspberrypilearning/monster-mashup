## Monster parts
The monsters you're going to generate have three parts to their name. A beginning, a middle and an end. Here's a few suggestions for each, but make up some of your own too!

### Beginnings
  - Giant
  - Mega
  - Greater
  - Lesser

### Middles
  - Draco
  - Doom
  - Death
  - Ice
  - Uni

### Ends
  - Cat
  - Tree
  - Owl
  - Ghost
  - Dragon

To start your program, you'll need three lists in Python, one for beginnings, one for middles, and one for ends.

## Python lists
Python has a type of variable called a **list**. It's used when you have a group of things that you want to keep together in one variable. They're usually all related somehow, like the songs released by a band or the players on a sports team.

#### Empty lists
This list has nothing in it yet. You can add **items** to the list later.

```python
my_list = []
```

#### Lists with things in them
This list has some numbers in it.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

This list has some text in it.

```python
my_list = ['cat',
           'dog',
           'rabbit']
```

You'll need to have three lists in your code, like this:

```python
name_start = ['Giant',
              'Mega',
              'Greater'
              ]

name_middle = ['Draco',
               'Doom',
               'Death'
               ]

name_end = ['Cat',
            'Tree',
            'Owl'
            ]
```
